## This tool was meant to be used with Mrobswag's DungeonQuest script, which is long gone, leaving no real use for this (DEPRACATED, USE [THIS](https://github.com/system69-e/Roblox-Autorestart) INSTEAD).

# RBLXAutorestart-with-onlyvip
the implementation of onlyvip to Curve's autorestart (looking over this again after some months, the way it is done is very bad and stupid, and probably the furthest you can get from proper)
